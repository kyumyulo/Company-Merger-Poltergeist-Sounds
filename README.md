# Company-Merger-Poltergeist-Sounds
Folder containing custom sounds for the Poltergeist mod (updated in conjunction with the Company Merger modpack hosted on Thunderstore) and a README with instructions on how to implement them.

!! Note that I do not own any of these sound effects and I do not intend on making any money from this modpack! If the creators of these sounds would like to remove them, I will do so without question. !!

# How to install:
## Open Thunderstore and a profile containing the Poltergeist mod
Choose a profile from your Thunderstore launcher that contains the Poltergeist mod by coderCleric. Make sure you have launched this profile before. I would suggest opening and joining a lobby just to be sure all necessary files are created.

## Open the profile's folder
From the Thunderstore launcher with your profile selected, click "Settings" along the left side of the screen. From the "All" or "Locations" tab, click "Browse Profile Folder." This should open your computer's file explorer.

## Find the Poltergeist folder
Open the following folders:
1. BepInEx
2. plugins
3. coderCleric-Poltergeist
In this folder, you will see a folder titled "sounds"

## Replace the sounds folder
Within this github file, you will see an identical "sounds" folder with a different set of sounds inside. Delete the sounds folder and replace it with the one from this github folder. Make sure everyone you play with does this, or they will NOT hear the same sounds as you!

That is all! Have fun!!
