# Company-Merger-Poltergeist-Sounds
Folder containing custom sounds for the Poltergeist mod (updated in conjunction with the Company Merger modpack hosted on Thunderstore) and a README with instructions on how to implement them.

!! Note that I do not own any of these sound effects and I do not intend on making any money from this modpack! If the creators of these sounds would like to remove them, I will do so without question. !!

# How to install:
## Download and prepare
Download this github file and take the "sounds.zip" file. Extract this file, and make sure that the contents are a single folder named "sounds" and several sound files inside. Keep this somewhere for the final step!

## Open Thunderstore and a profile containing the Poltergeist mod
Choose a profile from your Thunderstore launcher that contains the Poltergeist mod by coderCleric. Make sure you have launched this profile before. I would suggest opening and joining a lobby just to be sure all necessary files are created.

## Open the profile's folder
From the Thunderstore launcher with your profile selected, click "Settings" along the left side of the screen. From the "All" or "Locations" tab, click "Browse Profile Folder." This should open your computer's file explorer.

## Find the Poltergeist folder
Open the following folders:
1. BepInEx
2. plugins
3. coderCleric-Poltergeist
In this folder, you will see a folder titled "sounds"

## Replace the sounds folder
Take the prepared folder from this github file (which should also be named "sounds",) delete the sounds folder from the Poltergeist folder, and replace it with the one from this github folder. Make sure everyone you play with does this, or they will NOT hear the same sounds as you!

That is all! Have fun!!
